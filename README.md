# Project 3
  The project was to create an Item tracking program. The problem that we were trying to solve was to create a program that would take in written list of items that were purchased and track which ones were sold the 
  most. The area with my code that I feel that I did particularly well was in creating the display from what actually shows up and how each of the chooses interact and impact the program. I feel like my code is 
  currently pretty limited in what it does and I feel that I could make it more versatile. It would make my code more efficient because it could be used for similar but different tasks or problems. For me the 
  part of the code that challenges me the most is creating the right loop for the type of program that I am trying to create. For me the tools that helped me the most besides trial and error was to look up 
  various loop guides and trying to see which oneâ€™s work. The skills from this project that will help me with other projects is the skill set of knowing where to look or research more in to when you get stuck on
  codes. I wrote a few comments on the code outlining what each part of the code does so if I need to edit it later I can.
